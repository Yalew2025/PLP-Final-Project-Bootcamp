# PLP-Final-Project-Bootcamp
Veterinary Telemedicine & Outbreak Investigation Platform

🎯 Context

Problem Statement: Small-scale farmers in rural and remote areas face significant challenges in accessing timely veterinary care for their livestock. Traditional veterinary services are often geographically inaccessible, expensive, and slow to respond to disease outbreaks. This leads to:

· Delayed treatment causing animal mortality and economic losses
· Limited access to specialized veterinary expertise
· Slow response to disease outbreaks leading to rapid spread
· Poor record-keeping of animal health history
· Financial constraints in accessing quality veterinary care

Industry Context: The global veterinary telemedicine market is growing rapidly, with Africa showing particular potential due to mobile technology penetration. However, most existing solutions focus on companion animals rather than livestock, creating a significant gap in agricultural veterinary services.

🎯 Goal

Primary Objective: Develop a comprehensive web-based platform that bridges the gap between farmers and veterinary services through digital technology, enabling accessible, affordable, and timely animal healthcare while providing real-time disease surveillance capabilities.

Specific Goals:

1. Accessibility: Enable remote consultations via chat, audio, and video calls
2. Affordability: Reduce costs associated with physical veterinary visits
3. Timeliness: Provide immediate access to veterinary expertise
4. Disease Control: Create early warning system for disease outbreaks
5. Record Management: Maintain comprehensive electronic health records
6. Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate information exchange between stakeholders
